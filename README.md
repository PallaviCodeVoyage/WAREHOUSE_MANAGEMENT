### Warehouse Inventory Management System

This project simulates a comprehensive warehouse inventory management system designed to reflect real-world operations. The system integrates multiple core functionalities that mirror actual inventory and logistics management processes:

- üìà **Demand Forecasting:** Utilizes historical sales data to project future inventory needs, enabling proactive stock level adjustments based on predicted demand.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Inventory Optimization:** Analyzes current stock levels in conjunction with forecasted demand, providing actionable recommendations to increase or decrease inventory levels as needed.
- üöö **Automated Stock Transfers:** Implements dynamic stock reallocation between warehouses, ensuring optimal distribution of products based on real-time demand and warehouse proximity. This process is guided by simulated logistical considerations, aiming to minimize transportation costs and balance stock across locations.
- üß∞ **Interactive Analysis and Reporting:** Equipped with a user-friendly interface, the system allows for on-demand analysis of inventory levels, stock transfers, and sales data. The integration of interactive widgets enhances the user's ability to make informed decisions quickly.

This model provides a realistic framework for understanding the complexities of inventory management, from demand forecasting to stock optimization and logistical efficiency. It serves as both a practical tool and an educational example of how modern warehouse management systems operate.
